## Ingredients

- 10g salt
- 325g water
- 100g Sourdough Starter
- 90g wholemeal bread flour
- 360g white bread flour

## Instructions

1. Mix the salt, water and starter until well mixed.
2. Add the flours and mix a bit until the dough forms.
3. Leave rest for 30 minutes covered.
4. Repeat three times: stretch and fold and leave for an hour covered.
5. One final stretch and fold (no leaving for an hour here)
6. Take out the dough and pre-shape it into a ball.
7. Leave rest for 30 minutes.
8. Dust with flour, so it doesn't stick, final shape and place in a banneton.
9. Cover and leave to rise for an hour.
10. Leave in the fridge overnight.
11. Preheat the oven to 250C with a Dutch oven inside.
12. Bake for 20 minutes with the lid on, then 15 minutes with the lid off.

### Tips:

1. Spray bread and put ice cubes in before putting in the oven for a crispy outside, this creates steam which helps with crusty outside.
2. First stretch and fold, knead the dough a bit to get a smooth ball
3. After each stretch and fold try to keep a smooth ball without cutting the outside
